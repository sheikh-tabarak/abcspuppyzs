            Goldendoodle Puppy Stages

        </h2>

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Training a puppy is always easier when you understand their developmental stages. Each stage of growth plays
            a role in your puppy's attention span, which directly impacts the training methods you'll use and how you
            should interact with your dog. Once you know a puppy's developmental stages, you'll find that training is
            both fun and rewarding!

                Socialization Stage (Phase I: 6 - 10 Weeks) </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Your puppy's attention span will seem like it's all over the place during this time but their memory is
                actually running in high gear and they'll catch on fast. Additional Socialization takes place during
                Phase II occuring around 10 - 14 Weeks, followed by the Final Phase, Phase III, which takes place during
                14 - 20 Weeks.

                During this stage, your pup is getting bigger and may feel like their growing size is a license to
                misbehave and act dominant. It's important to stay firm with your pup and be affectionate without being

            First Steps: How to House Train a Goldendoodle Puppy
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            My beautiful Goldendoodle puppy has arrived at its new home. Now what?

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Before you get started on house training a puppy, let him/her get used to their new surroundings and family
            for a few days. Remember, your puppy is just as overwhelmed and excited as you are, so you probably don't
            want to confuse them with training until they've settled in (check out our article on preparing your home
            Before the Big Day to be ready for your new puppy!). Once your pup starts to feel comfortable and at home,
            you can begin to slowly train them in the form of play. Experts suggest starting puppy training in the form
            of play as early as seven weeks. During this stage, your puppy will have an adorably short attention span
            but will also have the ability to remember things permanently.

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            During the first several months, spend a couple of minutes a few times a day giving short puppy lessons. You
            won't have to worry about any sophisticated obedience training methods until your puppy has reached 4 - 6
            months of age, which we will cover in a separate article.

                How to Potty Train a Goldendoodle Puppy:

            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Puppies are just little fur babies, so they'll need time to take control of their bodies — particularly
                their bladders. It's a general rule of thumb for puppy owners to take their pup outside every two hours
                for the first several weeks (unless you're ok with an incident in the house). This way your pup will
                develop a habitual desire to do their business outside and look forward to it as they grow
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Always congratulate and praise your puppy after a successful toilet trip outdoors. Dogs love adoration,
                and when they begin to associate your happiness with going potty outside, they'll learn to hold it in
                just to make you happy
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Keep an eye on your puppy as much as possible when you're in the house to stop accidents before they
                happen. As you get to know your Goldendoodle puppy, you might start to pick up on little behaviors that
                give away their messy intentions before they occur
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Of course, you're not expected to spend your whole day taking your puppy outside. That's the beauty of
                crate training, which is interconnected with potty training and gives you more flexibility in raising
                your pup. At first, your puppy may not want to relieve themselves in their crate because that is where
                they stay. But they'll quickly learn that you'll always clean their mess and that you're VERY happy when
                they go potty in their crate (as opposed to on the carpet!)
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                You should never punish your Goldendoodle puppy for pee or poop accidents because it will stress them
                and may cause them to do it in hiding to avoid getting in trouble. The best reinforcement for a puppy is
                praise, treats and lots of pets. Instead of getting upset, just be patient and show your puppy where you
                want it to go potty and reward them when they do
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Once you've got a handle on your puppy's potty schedule, you can try to teach them how to let you know
                it's time with the help of a bell
            </p>

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Generally, dogs need to go to the toilet after they eat, sleep and exercise
            </p>

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                When there's an accident in the house, make sure to clean it thoroughly and deodorize it to keep your
                puppy from coming back to the smell

                Buy a spacious crate for your puppy where they can feel safe, comfortable and be master of the castle

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Try feeding your puppy inside of their crate to associate that place with good things happening as
                opposed to a form of confinement or punishment
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Let your puppy get comfortable with their crate and give them the freedom of going in and out before you
                start to gradually shut the door
            </p>

                Praise your puppy if it sits in the crate with the door shut and doesn't bark or whine Begin with
                closing the door for only a few seconds and gradually increase the amount of time the door stays closed
                until your puppy feels comfortable whether the door is open or closed

                How to Potty Train a Goldendoodle Puppy:


            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                One of the best parts about raising a puppy is discovering their ability to understand and respond to
                verbal commands. From showing off to just having fun, teaching your puppy commands is an experience that
                pays off forever. Dogs have been known to learn some pretty neat tricks and can even be helpful around
                the house when they grow up and find themselves in a bigger family role. By the time you pick up your
                Goldendoodle puppy from ABCs Puppy Z's, they'll be at least 10 weeks old — and more than ready to start
                learning some basic commands!
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Even though your puppy's attention span is limited during this stage of their life, it's never a better
                time to imprint some basic commands on their permanent memory. Command training early on also serves to
                develop healthy habits such as obedience and communication, which leads to good behavior. When training
                a puppy tricks, you will be teaching it how to respond to your verbal commands through positive
                reinforcement and a method called food-lure training.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Puppy training should always be a fun and gentle experience and you should never use any type of
                punishment to train your dog. Keep each training lesson short while spreading out a few 5-minute lessons
                throughout the day. The more often you can train your puppy, the better. While you don't have to train a
                puppy tricks every single day, it's best not to wait too long in between lessons if you really want
                those commands to stick.

                Before You Begin
            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                At this early stage in their lives, puppies are easily distracted by the things around them — and can
                lose interest in ten different things in a matter of seconds. Their adorably limited attention spans are
                a joy to watch, but can present a challenge when teaching a puppy new tricks. If you plan on getting
                anywhere with your pup, you'll have to pick out a quiet “puppy classroom” in the house where there are
                very few things or noises that can distract them. Ideally, it should be just you, your pup, and some
                treats.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Your puppy's reward should be whatever they love most — whether it's their favorite treat or their
                favorite toy. Professional trainers have found that training a pup with their favorite treats for a few
                minutes before mealtime works well, as the puppy will be getting hungry and is motivated to win a treat.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Training your puppy involves two rewards:
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                <li>
                    A primary reinforcer (a treat or a toy)
                </li>
                <li>A secondary reinforcer (petting and verbal praising, i.e., “good boy!” or “good girl!”)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                When learning how to train a Goldendoodle puppy, it's important to use both reinforcers, because you
                won't always be able to give your dog a treat when they follow a command (and you shouldn't have to!).
                Your puppy will need to learn that being petted and praised for listening is also a reward. As time goes
                by and your puppy gets good at following commands, you can start phasing out treats and only give them
                sometimes, while always giving them praise for following commands. The older your dog gets, the more
                willing it will be to follow your commands on the simple basis of being obedient.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">

                For your dog to learn the meaning of a word, you will need to associate an action with the word you're
                saying. So, with every trick, you will need to show your puppy what the word means, for example, when
                saying sit, your puppy should be sitting. So, without further ado, let's get started!

                How to Train a Goldendoodle Puppy to Sit

            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                With a treat in hand and a quiet place to practice, you're now ready to teach your Goldendoodle puppy to
                sit!

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Remember, the first goal of puppy training is to teach them what the command actually means. Once they
                learn, you'll be able to practice until they comply without hesitation. There are two methods to teach
                your puppy to sit, and you should practice them both until they get the meaning. The methods are:

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                <strong class="text-gray-700"> The Capture Method:</strong> This training method implies that you're
                “capturing” the sitting action while giving them praise. For example, you'll stand in front of your pup
                with a treat in hand, and wait for the pup to sit. As soon as they sit on their own, give them a treat
                and some praise. Wait for your puppy to stand up again, and when they sit, reward them and praise them
                again. After several repetitions, say the word “sit” the moment they start to sit. This way, you're
                “capturing” the action and associating sitting with the word “sit”. After successfully “capturing” their
                sitting action several times, try saying sit before they sit, and see if they sit!

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                <strong class="text-gray-700"> The Lure Method:</strong> This method will let you “lure” your puppy into
                a
                sitting position. When your puppy is standing on all fours, get in front of them and hold the treat in
                front of their nose. Then, slowly move the treat above their head. As you do, your puppy should try to
                sit down to get a better look at the treat. As soon as they're sitting, let them eat the treat and give
                them praise. After repeating this several times, begin saying sit when your puppy sits, followed by a
                treat and some happy praise. Once your puppy knows to sit to get the treat and begins to associate the
                word with the action, you can try saying “sit” before placing the treat above their head!

                How to Train a Goldendoodle Puppy to Come


            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                You probably won't have a lot of trouble getting your puppy's attention, and you might even be able to
                teach them this command naturally when you want them to come. But the goal of training your puppy to
                come also has to do with getting them to respond to their name or a specific word, like “come”.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                <li>Begin by taking your puppy to a quiet place like a big room in the house. Say their name or the word
                    “come” (whichever you prefer, but remember that if they learn to come when they hear their name,
                    they'll always come when they hear their name!) and reward your puppy with a treat and praise when
                    they do. Then, toss a treat away from you, and when they finish the treat, say their name (or come).
                    As soon as they look at you, reward them with a treat.</li>
                <li>Try not to say their name (or the come command) over and over when they're not responding. Instead,
                    move closer and try again. When your puppy responds and is eating their treat, start changing
                    positions. Then say your puppy's name and drop a treat next to you when they look at you. Your puppy
                    will respond and come running for the treat, and when they do, give them lots of pets and happy
                    praise. Then move away and try again, increasing the distance between you and your pup the better
                    they get.</li>
                <li>After a while, you can try practicing at greater distances, such as while outdoors. When playing
                    with your puppy outside, you should always be in a safe and enclosed location (such as a gated
                    backyard) or have your puppy on a leash. When training your puppy to come while in a park or other
                    location, you can put your puppy on a long leash.</li>
                <li>Keep in mind that dogs learn to respond to commands through praise, so when you call your dog, you
                    should never punish them afterwards (even if they're up to trouble). That's because your dog may
                    associate coming to you with punishment, which will confuse them and can make them hesitant.</li>
            </ul>

                How to Train a Goldendoodle Puppy to Stay
            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                The stay command will include the cue word, “stay”, and a release word, such as “up”, “ok”, “move”, or
                whatever you prefer. For the stay command to work, your puppy will need to learn the meaning of both the
                cue word and the release word, but knowing the “sit” command is also a big plus (this really helps them
                learn to stay!).
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                <li>Begin by teaching your puppy the release command. First, wait till your puppy is sitting or
                    standing, then, drop a treat on the floor and say the release command when they go for the treat.
                    After several repetitions, back away and say the release command as they start to move toward you
                    and THEN drop a treat. After a while, your puppy will begin to associate moving around with the
                    release command</li>
                <li>Once your puppy gets the hang of the release command, the “sit” command comes into play. Tell your
                    puppy to sit, and give them a treat when they do it. Now, wait a little bit while your puppy is
                    sitting (without saying anything), and give them another treat. Then, say the release command, and
                    when they get up, give them a treat</li>
                <li>Now, try waiting longer before you say the release command (10-20 seconds), and see if your puppy
                    can stay still for that long. If they get up on their own, just reduce the amount of time you wait
                    before trying the release command again. When you're able to get your puppy to sit still for a
                    while, say “stay” and take a step or two backwards. If your puppy gets up, try again. If they stay
                    sitting, give them a treat, followed by the release command</li>
                <li>Slowly start increasing the distance between you and your pup while they are sitting. Try turning
                    around and walking away a few steps before facing your dog again. Pace yourself while training your
                    puppy on the stay command — even a few steps is a big achievement! Keep your training short,
                    rewarding and frequent for best results</li>
            </ul>

                How to Train a Goldendoodle Puppy to Lie Down

            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Having fun yet? Don't worry, it gets easier! The lie down command is taught in much the same way as the
                sit command — by using the “capture” technique. By now, your puppy should have a good idea of what the
                release command means, which you'll be using to teach them how to lie down. If your puppy doesn't
                respond to the release command yet but you've got your mind set on teaching them how to lie down, you
                can always make them get up using a lure technique (a sniff of the treat should do the trick!).

                <li>As with all other training methods, take your puppy to a quiet place where you can get (and hold!)
                    their attention. Wait for your puppy to lie down and give them a treat. Then, say the release
                    command and give them a treat when they get up</li>
                <li>Wait for your puppy to lie down again, and as they are about to do it, say the “down” command to
                    “capture” the action. Repeat this process for a while, and then try saying the “down” command when
                    they are sitting or standing to make them lie down</li>
                <li>To speed things up, you can try luring your pup down into a lying position with a treat. As your
                    puppy lies down, say the “down” command and give them the treat with lots of happy praises</li>

                As far as basic commands go, that's pretty much it! There's nothing cooler than a little pup that knows
                how to sit, come, stay and lie down. You’ve now learned how to train a Goldendoodle puppy tricks, and
                through your commitment and regular practice, your puppy will get the hang of it before you know it. And
                by training early, you'll be opening the door to more advanced obedience training that will come in
                handy as your puppy grows into an adult dog.

                For dog owners, there's nothing more rewarding than having an obedient and trustworthy companion at
                their side. Everyone loves a good dog, from your family and friends to your neighbors and people out in
                public. So, train early and keep it up — sooner or later, your efforts will always pay off!

            Having a puppy presents its messes and challenges, but the amount of joy, love and fun your puppy will give
            you makes it more than worthwhile. When you approach puppy training with a positive mindset, not only is it
            easier, but it's more rewarding. Remember that your puppy won't be little forever, and one day they'll be a
            fully grown and responsible member of the household. You might even miss training your puppy so much you'll
            wish you could do it all over again!

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            For an efficient training journey, start at the early stages and provide your puppy with lots of love,
            praises and plenty of activities. Once you've successfully managed to potty and crate train your pup, you're
            ready to move on to the next step — obedience training.
