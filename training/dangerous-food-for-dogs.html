            It's hard to say no to those puppy eyes when your lovable Goldendoodle puppy is begging for a bite of your
            food. But knowing every type of dangerous food for dogs is one of the most important responsibilities of a
            dog owner. From upset tummies and discomfort to serious symptoms and illnesses, feeding a puppy human food
            can lead to health consequences, expensive vet visits and even the loss of a pet.

            The list below is here to serve as a guide to safe pet ownership when there's a hungry fluff-ball in your
            life — and a curiosity that knows no bounds. Any dog owner can tell you that dogs love to eat, and even an
            adult dog must be supervised when there is food around. So not only will you need to actively avoid feeding
            these foods to your dog, but you need to make sure they are not accessible to your dog at any time. With a
            little discipline and some force of habit, you'll get the hang of it quickly — and keep dangerous human
            foods away from your dog like it's second nature. Below is a list of human food that is dangerous food for
            dogs.

                Chocolate </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Chocolate is a dangerous food for dogs because it contains a chemical called theobromine, which humans
                have a tolerance for but causes immediate toxicity in dogs. Theobromine can lead to a range of symptoms
                in dogs, including vomiting, diarrhea, thirst, tummy pain, frequent urination, irregular heartbeat,
                hyperactivity, muscle tremors, lethargy, restlessness, seizures and death.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Symptoms of theobromine poisoning in dogs typically occur between 4 to 24 hours after ingestion. It's
                important to note that dark chocolate has much higher levels of theobromine than milk chocolate and
                white chocolate, which makes it significantly more dangerous. Of course, you should always avoid feeding
                your puppy chocolate altogether to ensure their safety.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[#186C91] my-2">
                Caffeine </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Caffeine is another poisonous chemical for dogs and can be found in chocolate, chocolate-containing
                products, coffee, tea, certain breakfast cereals, sodas and coffee-flavored ice cream. Caffeine is a
                member of the methylxanthines family of substances, of which the theobromine found in chocolate is also
                a member. Caffeine ingestion in dogs can lead to similar symptoms as in the case of theobromine
                ingestion and should always be avoided. Because chocolate contains both caffeine and theobromine, it's
                extremely important to keep chocolate out of your puppy's reach.

                The Onion Family: Onions, Garlic, Chives, Shallots and Scallions </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                The onion family (Amaryllidaceae) is a dangerous food for dogs and includes onions as well as garlic,
                chives, shallots and scallions. While the onion family has some notable health benefits in people, it
                has the complete opposite effect on our pups. These foods contain certain compounds that are toxic to
                both dogs and cats, and can cause gastroenteritis, damage to red blood cells, anemia and associative
                conditions such as organ failure. If your dog has eaten any of these vegetables, the symptoms may not
                appear for several days. Symptoms of onion or garlic poisoning in dogs include off-colored urine (orange
                or red) and lethargy. Keep in mind that no type of onion family vegetable is safe for doggie consumption
                whether it's cooked, dehydrated, powdered or otherwise — so keep the pup away from the leftover pizza
                and other foods containing any traces of the onion family.

                Xylitol </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Xylitol is a common artificial sweetener found in sugar-free candy, gum, baked goods and diet snacks as
                well as in certain toothpaste, mouthwash, cough drops and chewable vitamins. Xylitol is considered
                extremely toxic to dogs and can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia (reduced blood sugar),
                blood-clotting disorders and liver failure. Symptoms of xylitol ingestion in dogs include vomiting, loss
                of coordination, lethargy and seizures, which may occur immediately after ingestion or after a period of
                several hours.

                Grapes & Raisins </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                You should never feed grapes or raisins to a dog and always supervise them around food that contains
                them — even in the smallest amounts (like fruit loaf and grandma's pecan pie). Grapes and raisins are a
                bit of a mystery when it comes to our pups. Some doggies can get away with eating them while others
                experience toxicity that can eventually lead to kidney failure. Symptoms of grape and raisin ingestion
                in dogs include vomiting, diarrhea and lethargy within 12 hours. If dogs experiencing grape or raisin
                poisoning do not receive immediate treatment, it can lead to dehydration and kidney failure in just
                days. Dogs with existing health problems are particularly at risk to the effects of grape and raisin
                poisoning. The fact that people don't often expect such severe symptoms from something as
                innocent-sounding as a grape or raisin makes them an especially dangerous food for dogs. It's best not
                to find out if your puppy can tolerate these foods and avoid them altogether.

                Alcohol is literally a poison — and the doggie metabolism is just not cut out for a drink. It's even
                more toxic to our pups than it is to us, and a drunk dog may be the least of your worries when it
                happens. Alcohol in dogs can lead to symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, disorientation, excessive panting,
                high body temperature, breathing difficulties, central nervous system depression, tremors, blood damage,
                coma and death. If your dog has ingested alcohol or you suspect they might be under the influence, seek
                immediate help from an animal poison control center.

                “Give the dog a bone” is a saying we've all heard, but it's actually not the best idea. Dogs love to
                chew — which is exactly why there are a world of chew toys and dog chews that your pup will love and
                chew safely. Real bones pose a choking hazard to dogs because they can splinter or get stuck in their
                throats and digestive systems when swallowed as well as damage their teeth during chewing. Take special
                care if you choose to offer your pup meat that contains bones, which is generally not recommended for

                One of the major differences between human-grade and feed-grade food is the allowance of chemicals such
                as mycotoxins. Feed-grade food typically contains much higher levels of this chemical — to the point
                where it can be considered toxic and a dangerous food for dogs. The thing is, mycotoxin itself isn't an
                ingredient, and you won't find it listed on the label. So how do you know if your puppy food has a lot
                of mycotoxins in it? That leads us to the next ingredient…

                So-called “meats” and “meals” are simply scraps which have been cooked to remove fat, leaving protein
                and other mysterious elements. There is no standard of quality regarding the source of these
                ingredients: it can come from almost anywhere and in any form. And while it's always superheated to
                remove pathogens, the process also destroys almost any nutrients that can be had from such an offensive
                creation. Unnamed meats, meals and byproducts also carry the risk of contaminants left over from the
                source, including large quantities of mycotoxins and…

                You won't find pentobarbital listed on your puppy food ingredients — but it doesn't mean it's not there.
                As long as your dog food is full of “meat”, “meals” or “byproducts”, pentobarbital might be along for
                the ride. This contaminant is an anesthetic used in the euthanasia of animals. So not only are our
                beloved pets supposed to eat leftover scraps of diseased animals, but they can also be consuming the

                These harmful chemical preservatives can lead to long-term health problems and have no business in your
                puppy's food. Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) and Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) are found in low-cost
                (and even standard) pet food brands and are actually banned in some countries. They are known
                carcinogens that have been shown to cause organ damage in rats and may be linked to conditions such as
                hyperactivity and cancer in human children.

                Ethoxyquin is a feed-grade preservative considered too toxic for human consumption. It is used in pet
                food to preserve its fat contents and extend the product's shelf life. Ethoxyquin can also be found in
                pesticide. Needless to say, anything with these chemicals in it can be considered a dangerous food for

                Rendered fat (sometimes called animal fat) is fat typically sourced from 4D meat — or the meat of
                diseased, disabled, dead or dying animals. This includes anything and everything from sick and dead

                can lead to kidney damage, kidney failure and death in dogs, making it a despicable culprit in dangerous
                food for dogs. In 2007, a major dog food recall took place all because of this ingredient.
                Unfortunately, melamine testing is not required yet (don't ask us why), and may not be listed on the

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">
                Oleander is another pretty flower with a mean streak when it comes to pets. These flowering bushy shrubs
                grow naturally in the western and southern United States, and are favored in private landscapes for
                their height (up to 12 feet) and blooming colors.

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">
                Oleander contains cardiac glycosides, which are the same toxin found in lily of the valley. These
                poisonous shrubs for dogs are toxic in all their parts, but their poison is concentrated in the stem.
                Symptoms of oleander poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, drooling, tremors,
                dehydration and loss of appetite, and can lead to clinical conditions of hyperkalemia (potassium
                imbalance), arrhythmia, bradycardia (slow heart rate), seizures, shock and death. Needless to say, being
                able to identify and avoid oleander should be in the toolkit of every dog owner.

                as upset stomach, drooling, diarrhea, intense vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, lack of appetite and
                depression when ingested. The most poisonous part of these plants is their bulbs, which makes them a
                particularly dangerous food for dogs that love to free-roam and dig. And while these flowers are rarely

                Dieffenbachia, which goes by the name of dumb cane, is so called because eating it will result in

                Fortunately, this tropical plant is native to locations south of the United States, so you're unlikely
                to run into it outside. At the same time, it is a very popular indoor decoration, so make sure to know

            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Mushrooms can grow just about anywhere, whether in the
                backyard, under the house or in the woods. And while only about 1% of all mushrooms species are known to
                be toxic, it's pretty hard to even know what you're looking at unless you know your mushrooms.
            </p>

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">
                In the United States, a mushroom species known as the Amanita, dubiously dubbed as the “death cap” and
                “panther cap”, has been responsible for the deaths of both humans and animals. And while rare, such
                dangerous species have been known to sprout up right in the yard.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">
                The severity of mushroom poisoning typically depends on the amount ingested and species of mushroom.
                Dogs may have no symptoms at all, or get better after a minor tummy ache. But serious cases of mushroom
                poisoning can involve symptoms of vomiting, panting, lethargy, confusion, increased heart rate,
                seizures, kidney failure, liver failure and death. Because it's hard to know the mushroom species type
                and safe limits of ingestion, a general rule of thumb is to consider them a dangerous food for dogs and
                simply avoid mushrooms altogether.

                Of course, it's much easier said than done! If you suspect that your dog may have eaten mushrooms, don't
                panic, and contact a local veterinarian to discuss details, symptoms and if treatment is necessary.
