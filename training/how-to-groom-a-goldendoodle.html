            Is Goldendoodle Grooming Really Necessary?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">

            One of many reasons the Mini Goldendoodle dog breed has become so popular is due to their non-shedding coat.
            <br><br>
            But here is a funny truth about the world of dog coat types:
            <br><br>
            The less visible shedding your dog does, the more grooming your Goldendoodle is likely to need. Why is this?
            <br><br>
            Goldendoodles with certain coat types show little-to-no signs of shedding because the dead hair really does
            shed out, but then it gets trapped in the surrounding coat. So, you never actually see the hair fall out.
            What does this mean for your pup?
            <br><br>
            It means your Goldendoodle will need your help to remove this dead, shed hair before it can form into
            tangles and then mats that mar their beautiful coat.
            <br><br>
            However, even the visibly shedding Mini Goldendoodle coat types require regular brushing, bathing, and
            grooming to stay healthy.

            What Does It Mean to Groom Your Mini Goldendoodle?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">

            If you are new to caring for a Mini Goldendoodle, you might quite legitimately wonder what “grooming” means.
            <br><br>
            Grooming describes the process of keeping your dog's skin and coat healthy and functioning as they were
            designed to function - as protection and insulation for your dog.
            <br><br>
            You have three basic choices when it comes to grooming your Mini Goldendoodle:

            <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Some Mini Goldendoodle Owners prefer to do everything themselves. This means bathing, brushing, ear
                cleaning, nail trimming and Goldendoodle haircuts as needed.
                <br><br>
                If you plan to show off your Mini Goldendoodle, you may find this is the smartest choice, as you have
                all the tools and know-how to groom your dog anytime, anywhere.
                <br><br>
                But this is also the choice with the steepest learning curve and the greatest initial investment of time
                and finances. You will need a specific set of tools and supplies, and you will need to learn the basics
                of giving your Mini Goldendoodle a haircut, ear cleaning and nail trimming.
                <br><br>
                Many professional groomers are also happy to show new dog owners the basics as part of the grooming
                appointment fee. So, this can be another great resource to lessen your learning curve.

                With this option, you don't need to acquire the full set of grooming tools or take your time to learn
                how to give your dog a haircut. However, you will need to budget for professional grooming every three

            <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">

                Probably the most popular choice for most Mini Goldendoodle owners is to take care of the basic brushing
                and grooming tasks at home but leave the big jobs like dog bathing and haircuts to a professional dog
                groomer.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes this is also the most practical choice, too, especially if your current home doesn't include a
                suitable place to bathe or groom a dog.
                <br><br>
                Even if you plan to take your Mini Goldendoodle to the professional groomer regularly, you will still
                need to learn to how to do the basic brushing and detangling tasks at home.
                <br><br>
                Conversely, even if you plan to handle most grooming tasks at home, it can be smart to take your Mini
                Goldendoodle puppy to the professional dog groomer for a bath, grooming and trimming or a puppy haircut
                around the five to six-month mark.
                <br><br>
                This way, your puppy is less likely to feel fearful of going to the groomer during adulthood.

            Different Goldendoodle Coat Types
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Goldendoodles can grow up to have three basic coat types or textures. The coat type your Goldendoodle puppy
            inherits may mean you need to do more or less grooming overall.
            <br><br>
            Here is a brief overview of the three basic Mini Goldendoodle coat types. (If you are having any trouble
            identifying your puppy's coat type, feel free to Get in Touch with us here at ABCs Puppy Zs and we would be
            happy to help!)

            <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                The flat coat is the type that is most like the Golden Retriever parent dog's coat. This coat type tends
                to shed out visibly more than the other types.

                The curly or wool coat is the type that is most like the Poodle parent dog's coat. This coat type tends
                to be called non-shedding because the shed hair gets trapped in the surrounding living coat.

                The fleece or wavy coat is the coat type that is most commonly associated with the Goldendoodle dog
                breed. This coat type typically does not shed out visibly and is considered to be an ideal choice for

            How Can You Tell Which Coat Type Your Goldendoodle Puppy Has?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">

            Genetics is what determines what coat type your Mini Goldendoodle is destined to have. In some cases, this
            can mean a big surprise for you when your dog's adult coat grows in!
            <br><br>
            The process your Mini Goldendoodle puppy will go through to shed out their puppy coat and grow in their
            adult dog coat can take some time.
            <br><br>
            This process can start anywhere from five to nine months of age. Some pups will shed out in fits and starts
            while for others the process will be very gradual.
            <br><br>
            (As a side note, when you choose a reputable and knowledgeable Goldendoodle Breeder like ABCs Puppy Zs, you
            get all the benefits of our years of dog breeding expertise. Among other perks, this means we can help you
            select the Goldendoodle puppy with the coat type that is perfect for your family and lifestyle.)

            Mini Goldendoodle Puppy Coat
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">

            You are probably wondering what the difference is between the Mini Goldendoodle puppy coat and the full
            adult dog coat.
            <br><br>
            There are several key differences:
            <br><br>
            The first and most obvious difference is that the puppy coat is thinner and softer than the adult dog coat.
            <br><br>
            The adult coat texture will also feel coarser to the touch regardless of coat type. And you will notice your
            dog's adult coat is thicker and more protective.
            <br><br>
            Another key difference is that the puppy coat itself doesn't shed out regularly like the adult coat does.
            When the puppy coat begins to shed out visibly, this is a signal that the adult coat is beginning to grow
            in.

            How Often Should You Groom a Goldendoodle?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Now let's take a closer look at what level of brushing and grooming each different Goldendoodle coat type
            requires so your dog always looks and feels their best.
        </p>
    </div>





    <ol class="relative border-l-[1.2px] border-[#186C91] mx-10 lg:mx-16">

        <li class="mb-10 ml-4">
            <div class="absolute w-3 h-3 bg-[#186C91] rounded-full mt-1.5 -left-1.5 border border-[#186C91] ">
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[#186C91] my-2">
                Flat or hair Goldendoodle coat type:
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">

                The flat or hair Mini Goldendoodle coat type is the coat type that most closely resembles the true
                Golden Retriever coat. Not only will you see the most shedding with this coat type, but you may notice
                more doggy odor as well - especially if your pup decides to roll in something!
                <br><br>
                But there is a bonus when you choose this coat type for your Mini Goldendoodle. The flat Goldendoodle
                coat is less maintenance intensive than the other two coat types.
                <br><br>
                With this coat type, the amount of grooming you have to do will really depend on you. The more you brush
                your dog, the less shed hair you will have to contend with. So if you are shedding-averse, more brushing
                can mean less hair on the couch cushions, carpeting and your clothing.
                <br><br>
                But you can also skip a day or few of brushing with a much lower risk of tangles and mats forming. For
                flat-coated Mini Goldendoodles who live a mostly indoor lifestyle, brushing once per week is often
                sufficient.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="mb-10 ml-4">
            <div class="absolute w-3 h-3 bg-[#186C91] rounded-full mt-1.5 -left-1.5 border border-[#186C91] ">
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[#186C91] my-2">
                Curly or wool Goldendoodle coat type:

            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                All the way at the other extreme we have the curly or wool coated Mini Goldendoodle. With this coat type
                - when it comes to grooming at least - all that beauty takes some behind-the-scenes brushing to
                maintain!
                <br><br>
                All dogs naturally shed to keep their coat and skin healthy and keep the protective properties of each
                hair functioning properly. Just because you don't see falling hair (or feel it coming out in your hand
                as you pat your dog) doesn't mean it isn't happening.
                <br><br>
                You will have proof once you begin brushing your curly Mini Goldendoodle.
                <br><br>
                The shed hair gets trapped in the surrounding healthy hair fibers. Because this coat type is so thick,
                you may need to use a long hair dematting rake to penetrate down to the skin level, work out any tangles
                or mats and remove all the dead, shed hair.
                <br><br>
                Brushing at least once every one to two days is a must for this Goldendoodle coat type.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="mb-10 ml-4">
            <div class="absolute w-3 h-3 bg-[#186C91] rounded-full mt-1.5 -left-1.5 border border-[#186C91] ">

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[#186C91] my-2">
                Fleece or wavy Goldendoodle coat type:
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                The fleece or wavy Mini Goldendoodle coat type falls right in the middle ground when it comes to
                intensity of maintenance.
                <br><br>
                Here again, your goal with brushing and grooming your Mini Goldendoodle is always going to be health as
                well as good looks. You don't ever want your pup to suffer from painful tangles and mats or the skin
                irritation and infection that can quickly follow.
                <br><br>
                Happily, maintaining a wavy Goldendoodle coat is not as maintenance intensive as the curly coat type
                even though both coat types shed out less visibly if at all.
                <br><br>
                As long as your Mini Goldendoodle leads a mostly indoor lifestyle, you may be able to go two to three
                days between full brushing sessions without risk of tangles forming. However, if your doodle comes in
                from outside with burrs or dirt in their coat, you will want to brush them right away.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-base font-normal text-gray-800 ">
            <li>Run the undercoat rake through the coat to remove any dead shed hair.</li>
            <li>Spritz canine detangling spray on the coat, taking care to avoid the eyes.</li>
            <li>Use a slicker brush to find and gently work out any tangles and mats.</li>
            <li>For any larger tangles or mats that may cause your dog pain, use round tip shears to clip out the matted
                hair.</li>
            <li>Next, run a stainless-steel round tip comb over the coat to locate any smaller tangles or mats and work
                or clip them out as needed.</li>
            <li>Also take this time to examine your dog's skin for any lumps, bumps, bites, hotspots, or other areas of
                concern.</li>
            <li>Now it is bath time! Be sure to use shampoo, conditioner and detangler that is ph-balanced for canine
                skin.</li>
            <li>After a quick towel dry, use the hairdryer on the cool or warm setting to dry your dog's coat
                comfortably and evenly.</li>
            <li>Clip the coat into the Mini Goldendoodle haircut you prefer.</li>
