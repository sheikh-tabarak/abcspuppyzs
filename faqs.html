                                A Goldendoodle is the wonderful result of a controlled cross-breed between a purebred male Poodle and a female purebred Golden Retriever. The idea was first conceived back in 1969, when breeders sought a guide dog that could match the Golden Retriever in obedience, health and trainability while suiting people allergic to dog hair.
                            </p><br><p>
The Poodle turned out to be the perfect match, and passes traits of intelligence, athleticism, a loving personality and great looks along with its non-shedding coat on to its Goldendoodle offspring. A match made in heaven!

                                It's all part of the fun! Since Goldendoodles get their traits from Poodles, you'll have the chance to love your Goldendoodle in various sizes from mini and micro to toy and teacup sizes!
                            </p><br><p>
                                Poodles were bred across generations for the purpose of making a smaller variety, so today there are 3 poodle sizes with an additional mini size unique to Goldendoodles.

                                Regardless of which size dog you're looking for, Our Goldendoodle Puppies retain all of the amazing qualities both parent breeds have to offer.

                                Great question! </p><br><p>

                                The different letters and numbers simply refer to the Goldendoodle's Generation and which percentage of Golden Retriever and Poodle are in that generation.
                            </p><br><p>
                                For example, an F1, also called F1A, is a First-Generation Goldendoodle with 50% Poodle and 50% Golden Retriever.
                            </p><br><p>
                                Breeding an F1 Goldendoodle with a purebred Poodle results in an F1B Goldendoodle, which is more Poodle than Golden Retriever at a ratio of 75% Poodle to 25% Golden Retriever.
                            </p><br><p>
                                An F1BB (typically referred to as an F1B) Goldendoodle is the result of cross-breeding between a first-generation F1B and a purebred Poodle. This breed is still more Poodle than Golden Retriever, but only slightly more Poodle than in a first-generation F1B.
                            </p><br><p>
                                In other words:
                            </p><br><p>
                                F1A = 1/2 Golden Retriever and 1/2 Poodle
                            </p><br><p>
                                F1B = 3/4 Poodle and 1/4 Golden Retriever
                            </p><br><p>
                                F1BB = Slightly more Poodle than F1B
                            </p><br><p>
                                Each Generation of Our Goldendoodle Puppies have unique qualities and come in various sizes!
