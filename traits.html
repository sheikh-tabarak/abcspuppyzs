                Great Health & Energy

            </h3>
            <p> Goldendoodles are known for their great health, vigor and longevity, with F1 and F1B breeds typically
                seeing a decrease in breed-related health issues common with golden retrievers and poodles.
                Goldendoodles age very well and have lifelong energy, which makes them the perfect companions for an
                active lifestyle and a family setting. All of Our Cute and Cuddly Goldendoodles come with Our 5-Year
                Health Guarantee and are bred from parent dogs that have passed a complete range of high-standard health
                screenings.</p>
            <p>
                As first and second-generation dogs, F1 Goldendoodle puppies and F1B Goldendoodle puppies are less prone
                to health issues known to occur with their purebred parent breeds, the Golden Retriever and Poodle. If
                you've ever had a purebred dog, you might be aware that their long lineages typically result in the
                development of certain ailments over time. Goldendoodle puppies are a new cross-bred dog, and at ABCs
                Puppy Zs, we take unique care to ensure that this new and loveable doggie lineage is off to a healthy
                start!

            </p>
            <p>By screening Our Puppy Moms and Dads for breed-specific health problems that range from dormant genes and
                delayed symptoms to hereditary traits of Golden Retrievers and Poodles, we're able to do everything
                possible to ensure that our mini Goldendoodle puppies for sale are the happiest and healthiest bunch in
                the world.</p>

                Goldendoodles Love to Please!


            </h3>
            <p> Okay, we know, pretty much all dogs love to make their owners happy. But there's something so unique
                about Goldendoodles and the way they just want to figure you out that makes them such a joy to be
                around. Something about having the intelligence of a Poodle and the trainability and companionship of a
                Golden Retriever simply brings out the best in a dog. A mix of both breeds, Our Mini Goldendoodles grow
                into wonderful companions that won't miss an opportunity to give you comfort and happiness with every
                little gesture.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll soon discover that you have something special with a mini goldendoodle puppy when you notice
                their attentiveness and desire to please even at an early age. At ABCs Puppy Zs, you'll be delighted to
                find trained Goldendoodle puppies ready to learn new tricks and become obedient and loving members of

                The New Dog on the Block!



            </h3>
            <p> One of the things that people love most about the Goldendoodle is that it's a new breed with a
                completely unique look. First bred in the 1960s, Goldendoodles didn't arrive to North America until the
                90s, where their popularity took off and spread out across the world. But because they're so new,
                doodles are still somewhat rare — and chances are you'll have the only doodle for miles!

            </p>
            <p>
                Owners of cute Goldendoodle puppies are commonly asked all kinds of questions about their dog and the
                Goldendoodle breeder that they got them from because people can't help but wonder about this new and
                beautiful dog. We even get a lot of referral calls from people who have seen Goldendoodle puppies going
                for walks in the street and now want one of their own.



            </p>
            <p>Our Mini Goldendoodle Puppies For Sale are ready to steal the show and your heart with their fluffy
                curls, gorgeous coats and variable golden colors. We choose to be a Goldendoodle Breeder because we find
                them completely irresistible — and we know you will too.

                Friendliness & Gentle Temperament!

            </h3>
            <p> Whether you're looking for a dog that's great with the kids or just want a friendly face that can put a
                smile on yours, Goldendoodles are a sure bet when it comes to being good company and having a happy,
                outgoing personality. Their calm demeanor is ideal for family homes and they are widely known to make
                fast friends with children and other animals — including cats!


            </p>
            <p>
                Our Texas Goldendoodle Breeder home is the perfect environment for getting a head start on Raising and
                Socializing Our Sweet Goldendoodle Puppies that thrive on human (and animal!) companionship, as we
                foster their natural sociability and desire to get along with everyone around them. Goldendoodles
                puppies and adult dogs are famous for their non-aggressive and patient temperament, which makes them
                among the most desirable family dogs in the world. They're great with kids and typically display extreme
                tolerance and patience when submitted to rough play by small children.




            </p>
            <p>Another popular feature among Goldendoodles is their extreme loyalty, which is an outstanding trait among
                both parent breeds and shines brightly in the miniature Goldendoodle line. This can make them very easy
                to train and showcase excellent obedience in public places where other animals, children and people
                visit and rely on proper pet ownership and control. Our mini Goldendoodle puppies are sure to grow into
                beautiful and loyal dogs that will be welcome everywhere and will always make great cuddle buddies in
                the comfort of home.

                Hypoallergenic Qualities


            </h3>
            <p> One reason many people around the world choose a Goldendoodle puppy is because of their hypoallergenic
                qualities. Goldendoodles tend to shed very little hair compared to other breeds and are a great fit for
                people with allergies or anyone that's looking for a low-maintenance dog that doesn't require constant
                cleaning-after. In many cases, Goldendoodles don't shed at all, which makes this dog breed particularly
                attractive to people with sensitive pet hair allergies. If you've always wanted a dog but get into a
                sneezing fit around animals, mini Goldendoodle adoption is just for you! These dogs were actually bred
                to be a hypoallergenic guide dog for allergy sufferers, and are a huge success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those destined to be a Mini Goldendoodle Breeder from the start saw the hypoallergenic potential of
                purebred Poodles and decided to breed them with Golden Retrievers, who contribute traits of trainability
                and obedience to the Poodle's qualities of intelligence and minimal shedding. The result is a smart,
                trainable and hypoallergenic dog that makes a great service animal and family pet. The best part is
                you'll never have to teach your Goldendoodle to stay off the couch — because they leave virtually
                nothing behind!

                Designer Looks



            </h3>

                pride and joy with looks that can melt your heart. Goldendoodles are also a frequent visitor at designer
                dog shows where they offer special characteristics in elegance and beauty.

                For kids (and adults!), the mini Goldendoodle puppy is practically a teddy bear come to life. You won't
                know what to do with all that adorable fluff as they run and tumble around the house, while growing into
                adult Goldendoodles that offer a great opportunity to experiment with doggie styles and haircuts!
                Whether your Goldendoodle puppy has straight, wavy or curly hair, it's sure to grow into a gorgeous dog
                with a designer coat of fur.

            <p> With every passing year, mini Goldendoodle puppies for sale are growing in popularity across the United
                States and the world — and for good reason. Goldendoodles have it all. They're clever, loyal, super
                friendly and have plenty of athleticism to offer. They make wonderful companions at home on the couch or
                outside at the park, at the lake or on a hike in the woods. Their hypoallergenic qualities make them a
                great choice for allergy sufferers and anyone that can't find the time to clean after their dog around
                the house. And that's just the beginning, because as dog owners know, every dog has a unique personality
