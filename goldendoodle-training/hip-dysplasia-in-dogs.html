            But as with all things health, we can only do our best. Even the most responsible dog breeding practices
            can't guarantee that conditions such as hip dysplasia do not occur. At least not yet, as research continues.

            Hip dysplasia is a condition known to happen in humans, dogs, and other animals. In hip dysplasia, the “ball
            and socket” of the hip and femur bone is not formed properly, which results in an irregular shape, fit and
            function of the joint. This affects how the surrounding muscles develop, which in turn leads to further
            deterioration of the joint.

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Hip dysplasia in dogs is a progressive condition that gets worse over time. As it does, dogs will exhibit
            more and more visible symptoms. These include reduced activity, stiffness, limping, swaying or “bunny
            hopping”, weakness or lameness in the hind legs, reluctance to go up stairs, reduced range of motion, loss
            of muscle mass in the back legs, increased muscle mass in the shoulders, discomfort, pain, and even unequal
            leg length.

            While hip dysplasia is more common in older dogs and larger breeds, it has been known to affect puppies and
            young dogs of all dog breeds, even the little ones. Fortunately, this article is designed to help owners
            understand the underlying causes of dog hip dysplasia, identify its signs, do their best to prevent it, and
            intervene as quickly and early as possible for the best chance of treatment.

            Scientists are Hard at Work

        </h2>

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Researchers have been busy trying to understand dog hip dysplasia for more than 5 decades. At the same time,
            responsible puppy breeders are doing their part to prevent any known associated hereditary traits from being
            passed on to future generations. And while the problem remains complicated, we have learned a lot about dog
            hip dysplasia and can now help treat and even prevent it by sharing knowledge.

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            When something is not congenital, it means it's not present at birth. All puppies are born with normal hips
            that are still composed of cartilage, which transforms into solid bone as they grow. This means that the
            condition can only begin to develop after birth…

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Scientists have learned that, as long as the hip structure remains the way it's supposed to, the condition
            will not develop as the joint grows. They also understand that the joint structure develops and grows in
            response to traction and stimulation from surrounding and internal tissue. In other words, something that
            the hip joint is doing or not doing may be causing hip dysplasia to develop as the joint grows…

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            One thing for sure is that some dog breeds and lines are more susceptible to this condition than others.
            This suggests a genetic connection, but scientists have yet to pinpoint the culprit—or culprits—at work.

            Genes are complicated, that much we get. For example, all dogs have 100% dog DNA. But a tiny portion of that
            genome is unique to each breed. These little differences are what give our pups their unique characteristics
            and make each breed special in its own right. And it's within this tiny and unique spectrum that the genes
            linked to hip dysplasia have been found, where they unfortunately differ from one dog breed to the other.

            Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) Can Help, but Only Somewhat
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) are a pedigree database of heritable traits that help puppy breeders select
            the healthiest and most desirable traits to pass on. This science-based and proven system helps narrow down
            healthy traits as well as unhealthy traits, enabling responsible breeding practices that lead to healthier
            dogs. EBVs are widely used in hopes of rooting out conditions such as canine hip dysplasia, but only to
            modest success in this case. With EBVs, you don't actually have to know the genes responsible, but are
            instead targeting an associated trait using calculated estimates based on a ton of data.

                After decades of gene studies and breed selection practices, we still haven't found a solution to hip
                dysplasia on the genetic front. But because a genetic root cause has been so elusive, it's actually led
                to an important discovery — hip dysplasia is not caused by genetics alone.

            What Kind of Environmental Factors?

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Depending on how you look at it, the fact that genetics alone does not cause canine hip dysplasia might be
            seen as good news. Yes, finding a gene or genes responsible for this awful condition and eradicating it for
            good is what we all want. We can only hope that one day this comes true, but genetic research and breed
            selection are a slow process. In the meantime, finding out that environmental factors are associated with
            dog hip dysplasia gives us hope. It means that we can actually do something about it!

                Joint Laxity
            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                In humans, joint laxity is another term for loose joints. In most cases, the condition is completely
                non-medical and can even provide for a greater range of motion. For example, people such as dancers,
                athletes and contortionists use it to their advantage and are the envy of those who can't.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                But in the case of doggie hips, joint laxity is not a good thing. It means that the “ball and socket”
                does
                not have a perfect fit. Because all puppies are born with normal hips, joint laxity is a malformation
                that
                takes place after birth.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                When joint laxity is present, there is a much higher risk of hip dysplasia developing. Joint laxity can
                take
                shape in different ways, such as a result of injury, muscle weakness, too much weight on the joint, or
                something known as adductor forces, which, in the case of hips, just means contracting the legs
                together.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                When there's joint laxity, it means the ligament between the ball and socket, known as the teres
                ligament,
                is loose or severed. In turn, the femoral head, or the “ball”, doesn't fit properly into the “socket”,
                or
                the acetabulum. As a result, the joint is unable to distribute forces properly. Instead of being fully
                supported by the inner socket, the ball ends up placing uneven pressure on the socket's rim, which is
                not as
                strong. As you can guess, this causes damage to the structure of the joint.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Through research, scientists found that the teres ligament could already be damaged before some puppies
                were even 1 month old. This was one of the first major findings linking possible environmental factors
                with hip dysplasia, and a big red flag.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                With a damaged teres ligament, the head and socket are no longer held firmly together. And with joint
                laxity at such an early age, the surrounding muscles are unable to develop as strongly as they're
                supposed to. It's the perfect recipe for the development of hip dysplasia at a very young age.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Since all puppies are born with normal hips, and the hip joint develops in response to stimulation and
                traction, then what could be causing a puppy's teres ligament to be damaged so early?

                Scientists have found no evidence of bone defects that could lead to this condition. In fact, what
                they've found is that hip bone dysplasia can actually be improved, worsened, or prevented altogether by
                the degree of joint stability and congruity. Hip dysplasia appears to be a meeting point for genetic
                weaknesses and environmental stresses, where these factors play on each other and lead to the condition,
                and ultimately degenerative joint disease, also known as osteoarthritis.

                Body Weight is a Major Culprit

            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                As we've discussed, hip dysplasia is a progressive condition that seems to involve multiple factors.
                Whether it begins with genetic weakness or it's just another fuel in the process, one problem sort of
                leads to another and hip dysplasia is the result.

            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                For example, joint laxity makes the joint vulnerable to environmental stresses, such as being under too
                much weight. Research has shown that heavier dogs are more susceptible to the condition, but so are
                puppies that are hefty at birth, as well as puppies that have a faster growth rate, or get big fast.
                Fortunately, scientists have found a connection between a restricted diet and a reduced risk of hip
                dysplasia. Young dogs kept on a restricted diet are more likely to develop hip dysplasia much later in
                life compared to those who are not on a restricted diet.

            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                It's only natural to not even think about a restricted diet until we feel it's necessary, like if our
                dogs are already overweight, or are older. But a study showed that, by 4 years of age, less than 10% of
                dogs on a restricted diet were developing hip dysplasia — compared to more than 30% of dogs who were not
                on a restricted diet.

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                The study was telling: it proved that weight management in young dogs was a gigantic factor in the
                development of hip dysplasia. But this isn't the only benefit of a restricted diet, which has also been
                associated with a longer life and preventing a slew of obesity-related illnesses in dogs.

                While genetic research is still ongoing, it's exciting to know that a restricted diet can stave off hip
                dysplasia until much later in life, control it, or even prevent it.

                The Role of Exercise

            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">

                Before you take your puppy for a game of fetch, let's talk about the role of exercise in puppy hip
                dysplasia and why it's both good and bad.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Nobody will argue that exercise is healthy. It helps boost circulation, cardiovascular health, fat
                burning, muscle and bone strength, energy levels, the immune system, and more. But as we've learned, hip
                dysplasia is a progressive condition that involves environmental factors which affect joint stability
                and congruity over time — and one of those environmental factors is exercise.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                On the one hand, exercise is necessary. Without it, the muscles that support the legs and pelvis can
                become weak, which puts extra pressure on the joints. At the same time, the type of exercise that
                puppies engage in can mean the difference between strengthening their hip joints and wearing them down.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Once puppies are born, their hips begin to grow, develop and transform from cartilage into bone. The
                period from birth to 8 weeks is the most important time for hip development, and in the case of these
                sweet Goldendoodle puppies, their little hips are fully under our knowledgeable care. But as long as
                puppies are growing, so are their hips. That's why it's important to consider all of these factors
                before your pupper is fully grown.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Studies have shown that puppies who spend a lot of time on slippery surfaces or running up and down
                stairs before they are 3 months old are at higher risk of developing hip dysplasia. Similar studies
                revealed that puppies who spend more time off-lead on soft ground (such as a well-kept lawn or park
                grounds) are actually at lower risk of developing puppy hip dysplasia.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Going further, it seems that puppies born during summertime have a lower risk of developing hip
                dysplasia. Since puppies born in warm weather are more likely to spend much more time outdoors than
                puppies born during cold weather, this suggests that outdoor exercise has something to do with hip
                dysplasia pathology.

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                But these studies come with an interesting caveat. Dogs aged 12-24 months who play a lot of fetch (such
                as chasing a ball or stick) were at higher risk of developing the condition. This in turns suggests that
                high-intensity running such as sprinting may have a negative impact on doggie hips when done regularly
                before the age of 2.

                Puppies who spend more time playing on soft and uneven ground outside are at a lower risk of hip
                dysplasia
                Puppies who spend more time inside playing on hard slippery floors and going up and down stairs are at
                higher risk of hip dysplasia
                It's best to promote outdoor play up to 3 months (and beyond of course)
                It's best to reduce going up and down stairs and playing/running on hard slippery surfaces before 3
                months (and perhaps longer as puppies continue to grow)
                Puppies and young dogs who play a lot of fetch or similarly engage in high-intensity sprints before the

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Puppies grow fast, and proper nutrition is essential for strong and healthy development. At the same
                time, for the reasons discussed above, overeating can become an immediate problem during the critical
                stages of joint and bone growth when the hips are most vulnerable to dysplasia.

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Not only is it important that puppies don't overeat, but it's also important they don't get an excessive
                intake of certain nutrients. This can happen if puppies eat too much or are being given nutritional
                supplements while growing and also consuming plenty of food.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                As long as puppies have a healthy, balanced and nutritional diet, they should not be given supplements.
                Doing so can cause excessive intake of certain minerals, such as calcium, and may lead to various health
                problems. We don't recommend doggie supplements until later in life or unless prescribed by a
                veterinarian under unique circumstances. As far as hip dysplasia goes, research has not found any
                evidence suggesting that supplementation of vitamins or nutrients can reduce the risk of development.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Like with so many things, it pays to nip it in the bud. Hip dysplasia tends to develop very early in a
                dog's life. By 4 to 6 months old, puppies can already be showing symptoms of lameness, pain or
                discomfort in the hips.

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                But hip dysplasia is also tricky. What happens is that once the damage is done, the microfractures begin
                to heal. The puppy can start feeling better, playing more and behaving normally after a few weeks.
                Concern turns to relief, and all seems well. But unfortunately, that's not the case. Even as the joint
                “heals”, the malformation remains. The dog will feel better, but the joint is no longer the shape it's
                supposed to be. As a result, the condition continues to worsen throughout the dog's life.

                Years can go by before the dog shows any symptoms of hip dysplasia again. This makes the condition very
                easy to overlook. And unfortunately, when treated later in life, the damage is much more significant.
                But the whole point of this article is to give dog owners an advantage over a progressive condition by
                catching it early. The great thing is that hip dysplasia is much easier to treat for puppies and young
                dogs. Success rates are much higher. There are more options.

                Depending on the dog breed, full skeletal growth can take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. As long as
                the puppy is still growing, a lot can be done to minimize dysplasia. With the help of a veterinarian,
                it's possible to detect joint laxity as early as 4 months old. Once a diagnosis and prognosis has been
                made, intervention can begin immediately to promote healthier development of the joints.

                Intervention can involve everything from weight management to specific exercises and even surgery. And
                while this might seem like a lot for a puppy, everything you do now to treat hip dysplasia can give your
                dog a heal

            In Conclusion

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">

            As research continues, we expect to see more slow and steady progress in genetic selection that helps filter
            out hip dysplasia from doggie gene pools. Meanwhile, responsible puppy breeders like us are always hard at
            work doing our part through EBVs and other selective breeding practices designed to promote dog wellness,
            longevity, and, in our case, wonderfully healthy Goldendoodles.

            As we've discussed in this article, even owners can contribute to preventing and treating dog hip dysplasia
            through management of environmental factors such as weight, exercise, nutrition and early detection and
            intervention. Together, we can use this knowledge in the fight against dog hip dysplasia and help reduce its
            incident rates, severity, and likelihood at different stages of the doggie lifespan.
