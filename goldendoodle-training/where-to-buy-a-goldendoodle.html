            Of all the things to get scammed for — and to what unthinkable lengths some crooks will go! While some
            people are just looking for a sweet and furry new family member, a few bad apples are out there trying to
            make a quick buck. And there's nothing too low and despicable for these people — least of all not pet
            adoption scams.

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Every year, would-be pet owners are conned out of millions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on
            supporting legitimate shelters and puppy breeders whose love of animals serves both local and non-local
            communities. Instead, that money goes straight into the pockets of petty crooks who take advantage of
            people's love for animals to con them out of their money. So what can you do to avoid falling victim to a
            cybercrime and pet adoption con artists when all you want to do is adopt a Goldendoodle puppy?

            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Like so many scams, puppy breeder scams rely on a
                simple-yet-effective method to part you with your money — up-front payments.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <!-- <br class="leading-tight m-0 p-0 font"> -->
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Scammers take advantage of something that is normally
                required by legitimate puppy breeders to secure orders from real customers and run a legitimate
                business. Just like you, real puppy breeders need to know they're dealing with real people who are
                serious about buying a puppy and not just wasting their time. To do this, they often require a deposit
                so they can schedule and account for the number of puppies still for sale and create a business
                correspondence with their customers that keeps everyone happy and everything running smoothly. </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Well, there's the rub. If you're not careful, you could be
                making a “deposit” to someone that has about as many puppies for sale as the neighborhood fish store.
                Unfortunately, puppy adoption scams are becoming more elaborate than ever with the internet serving as a
                digital black market for cybercrime opportunities. Many puppy adoption scammers post ads on websites
                such as Craigslist and Facebook, while others go as far as to set up entire websites for the purpose of
                collecting your “deposit” and riding off into the sunset. </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">And it may not even stop there. A “deposit” can just be the
                first of many payments you'll be asked to make by a scammer busy working on excuses that require more of
                your money. After your “deposit”, you may be asked to make payments for animal insurance, vaccinations
                and delivery. The scammer will probably stall for time at every corner, and somehow, somewhere, you'll
                need to make another payment to get a little closer to your new puppy. </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Unfortunately, these bad actors are always coming up with
                excuses on why everything needs to be done from a distance. Because of regulations in social distancing
                designed to keep us all safe, pet adoption scammers are making even more money on people just looking
                for a sweet pet to help them get through these tough times. We can't express enough about how these
                people make us feel as dedicated puppy breeders, and how much we can't wait for the law to catch up to
                them. In the meantime, here are some great tips on avoiding puppy scams and pet adoption scams in
                general! </p>

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Don't let the idea of pet adoption scams keep you from
                adopting a sweet Goldendoodle puppy from a genuine puppy breeder! Yes, puppy scammers can be sneaky, but
                there is plenty you can do to sniff them out and bust them before they get a dime. Due diligence is
                always a valuable investment of your time when you're planning to make a business transaction with a
                company or person that you're unsure about. Oftentimes, a simple background check can do wonders in
                revealing information that would otherwise stay hidden and would be to your detriment were you to
                proceed without it.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Any legitimate family-raised puppy breeder will have a
                specific location and contact information where they can be reached and found. If you are near their
                location, ask if you can pay them a visit to confirm that their home exists. While there is a pandemic
                and social distancing is strongly advised, eager pet owners and genuine puppy breeders should still be
                able to arrange a socially-distanced meeting that gives them all the proof they need. This can involve
                something as easy as staying in your car and getting a view of the puppy parents or the puppies
                themselves, or simply just confirming that the people you're talking to can actually be found at their
                home.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">If you are willing to travel to their home but the seller
                would rather “meet you halfway” or at a public location — it's a huge red flag. Any legitimate puppy
                breeder is not only happy to provide you their address but even give you a tour of the family-raised
                puppy environment and show you what a caring home they live in. Genuine puppy breeders should be the
                opposite of shy when it comes to showing you how and where the puppies are raised. Provided that they're
                responsible breeders, allowing you to see the puppy home will only reinforce your confidence in deciding
                where to buy a Goldendoodle.

                With
                Their Veterinary Contacts
            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">ALL puppies and puppy parents need to have veterinary visits,
                and any legitimate puppy breeder should be able to provide veterinary certifications on both the puppies
                and the puppy parents. One of the first things you should ask for when doing a background check on a
                puppy breeder is which veterinarian they work with. Obviously, the veterinary clinic will need to be
                near the breeder's location and should be an established business with contact information and an
                address.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">If the breeder is elusive and unwilling to provide a
                veterinary background check on the puppies they're selling, hang up the phone. They might also say they
                have an in-house veterinarian that looks after their pups. That's NOT how it works. Veterinarians are
                required by law to have a practicing license. And in order to provide services, they must have an
                establishment — otherwise they can't provide the legal certifications for the puppies and the puppy
                parents. Whether this is the case or not with the breeder in question, one who is unwilling or unable to
                connect you with their veterinary provider should be avoided when deciding where to buy a Goldendoodle.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Once you reach the puppy breeder's veterinary contact, run a
                background check on the breeder and on the types of puppies they are putting up for sale. A call with
                the veterinarian should be able to confirm the puppies' and puppy parents' breeds, ages, how often the
                breeders visit and how long they've been working together. The more good things the veterinarian has to
                say about the puppy breeders, the more confidence you'll have that they're a legitimate business just
                looking for loving homes for their pups.

                their adventures together! Because the customers are so happy with their dogs, they might even be
                willing to receive a call, show you pictures of their dogs or otherwise provide information that will
                reassure you that you're dealing with a real and responsible puppy breeder.

                step closer to bringing that sweet and lovable fluff into your home. As we've discussed, pet adoption

                Pictures
                and Videos
            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">Assuming the puppy breeder actually has puppies or parent
                dogs, they shouldn't have any trouble doing a video call on request. This will not only show you that
                they're comfortable with what they're doing, but it will also give you the chance to take a video tour
                of the puppy breeder's home and see the parent dogs or puppies in their natural environment.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">
                If for any reason a video call is not possible (if the seller declines, ask them why), you can also ask
                to see pictures of the dogs next to specific items on request. Ask to see pictures of the dog with a
                specific but random item next to them, such as a common household item or a unique phrase or words
                written on a piece of paper. This way you'll know that the puppies or parent dogs are actually real and
                you can move on to the next step in your background check and decide where to buy a Goldendoodle.

            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">
                However, a video call should be an important step in your background check. If the puppy breeder can't
                do a video call at the moment, ask them when it's a good time and if you can reschedule. If there's
                never a good time to do a video call, it's probably for all the wrong reasons — and you should just move
                on.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">One of the quickest and most insightful checks you can run on
                any business is reading reviews on sites such as Google My Business, Yelp, Facebook, BBB (Better
                Business Bureau), Yellow Pages and Manta. If the puppy breeder is an established business like they
                claim, then you should be able to find reviews about their services and website on at least some of the
                sites listed above.

            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">
                If you can't find any reviews on the breeder, it's probably a red flag. Considering that they are trying
                to do business with you online, they should have reviews of their services online. It's not very

                make sure to run a background check on the site to see if it's an established platform with a good

            </h3>
            <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">This step comes naturally to those looking for the best deal
                on a puppy with research on competitive local and non-local pricing. Generally, puppy breeders create a
                price that matches their investment of time and resources into breeding and caring for healthy and happy
                puppies. Among the majority of any specific puppy breed, you should be able to recognize a fair price
                that may vary slightly in either direction but not be too high or too low in comparison to other
                breeders. Watch out for breeders whose pricing is much lower than other breeders — if not too good to be
                true. Highly discounted puppy prices are a red flag that may signify what's called a Puppy Mill, or a
                dog-breeding operation that produces high volumes of puppies in awful conditions. And that's only if
                it's not a scam altogether.

                puppy breeder's interest in who you are — it's probably the most obvious giveaway! Any responsible puppy

                know who you are and where their puppy is going, it's not a good sign. In fact, a responsible puppy

                puppy will live in, if you've had pets before or if you have other pets now, and will ask you to sign a
                contract that may require you to spay or neuter the puppy.

                altogether. There's no reason they should require cash only unless they're trying to keep the
                transaction off-record and under the table. As a legitimate business, responsible puppy breeders should
                be more than happy to accept a Credit Card or Digital Payment System such as PayPal.
