            How to Prepare for a New Puppy
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            So, you've made up your mind and you're getting a Goldendoodle puppy! Who doesn't love getting booped by a
            tiny wet nose and pampered with unlimited snuggles? These little bundles of joy bring love into your life
            and quickly develop affection towards every member of your family. Of course, being a dog owner comes with
            major responsibilities, and it's best to be prepared before the big car ride home. Getting your home and
            family ready for a furry new member will not only help your puppy settle in, but makes it easier to raise
            your pup and is the start of a wonderful friendship.

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Just like kids, puppies have their quirks about feeling happy and safe in their new home. And just like
            kids, they'll need some things and space of their own. Puppies require essentials such as bedding, toys,
            leashes, a crate, potties, and plenty of food and treats to be their happiest selves. As a new puppy owner,
            you should also be prepared to do some cleaning while your puppy learns the difference between right and
            wrong, so it's a good idea to have plenty of cleaning supplies around the house.

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Pre-puppy preparation is a great way to get a head start on your pup, and includes buying essentials as well
            as taking a few simple lessons on puppy ownership. The more prepared you are to have a puppy, the easier the
            experience will be on everyone — especially on your new pup. Here are a few tips on how to care for a
            Goldendoodle puppy before a fluffy ball of happiness tumbles their way into your home and your heart.

            Being Mentally Prepared for a New Puppy

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            After the initial excitement and first few days, it's time to make your Goldendoodle puppy feel at home
            while preparing to train and discipline them into good habits. It's important to know that while dog
            ownership comes with infinite rewards, it takes effort and commitment similar to that of raising a child.
            After all, if dogs were so simple to own, they wouldn't be dogs — they'd be cats!

            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                There will be no shortage of fun and love with a puppy in your home, but there will also be the
                occasional oopsy, uh-oh, and oh-no. Here are a few surprises you should expect:

            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                <li>
                    Puppies love to chew! Chewing helps them cope with the sensation of growing teeth as well as develop
                    strong jaws and teeth early on. If they happen by a fresh pair of shoes or other chewable object,
                    the temptation may be too much too resist

                </li>
                <li>You might lose a little sleep from time to time. Puppies often whimper when they're lonely, being
                    disciplined, or just not getting what they want. This is typically resolved with healthy
                    conditioning over time, but don't be surprised if that lazy morning is a little more exciting than
                    you're used to for a while
                </li>
                <li>Things will probably get broken. Until they know better, puppies might view some of your possessions
                    as expendable playthings. Having to fix or replace a thing or two is normal with a puppy and is
                    easier to cope with if you have some “puppy savings” in the bank
                </li>
                <li>In short, be ready for anything — but mostly sweet and funny things! If your puppy does something
                    entertaining or adorable, please don't hesitate to let us know. We do love a good laugh
                </li>

                Your new Goldendoodle puppy will have more than enough energy and love for every member of the family,
                so everyone should be on the same page as far as responsibilities go. Make sure to discuss the details
                with your family and set a few ground rules for everything to go as smoothly as possible.

                Once you get that out of the way, it's time to decide on the vocabulary list you're going to use to
                train a Goldendoodle puppy. Dogs have a great memory and respond well to verbal commands — once they
                understand them. It's important for everyone in the family to use the same language and tone to get the
                idea across to your new pup, who will start picking up on the meaning as they associate certain words
                with actions. This privilege will also extend to anyone that takes part in raising your pup, such as
                walkers, nannies, friends and people on your daily routine. A simple trick to puppy training is writing
                down all the common words you'll say to your pup and putting the list on your fridge door or somewhere
                clearly visible.

                If you don't pet-proof your home when introducing a new puppy, you're just asking for trouble. These
                simple precautions will save you money and a few hairs on your head from the stress of puppy-related
                accidents:
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 list-disc pl-5">
                <li>Set up a puppy-proof area. This will be a safe and easy-maintenance location in your home where the
                    puppy will do minimal damage and can spend most of its time playing and sleeping during the first
                    several months of its life</li>
                <li>Install baby gates to create a buffer zone between your pup and the things you don't want them
                    around. This is essential for both your puppy's safety and the protection of your belongings.
                    However, please note that accordion-like gates can be very dangerous for a puppy and you should
                    always opt for puppy-safe gates</li>
                <li>Make sure to secure the staircase until you're sure your puppy can go up and down the stairs by
                    itself and without falling</li>
                <li>Don't leave any cleaning supplies or other hazardous products or objects within your puppy's reach
                </li>
                <li><strong> <a class="text-black" href="dangerous-food-for-dogs.html">Remove plants</a></strong>,
                    carpets and other things
                    that a puppy can easily ruin, or place your
                    puppy in a location where such things are not within reach</li>
                <li>Do your best to cover or hide any electrical cords and wires. You can do this by tucking them behind
                    cabinets and furniture or installing covers over your cables and wires</li>
                <li>Adopt the habit of picking up everything after yourself and leaving very little to chance. This
                    includes putting clothes, shoes and other belongings away and out of the reach of mouth and paws
                </li>
                <li>Remove long curtains and table clothes while your puppy is growing to avoid awkward stare downs</li>
                <li>It's a good idea to have a spacious crate around for times when you can't supervise your puppy but
                    can't risk leaving them in charge of the house. A puppy crate is a safe and comfortable enclosure
                    where your puppy can spend the night or hang out when you're unable to watch them. It also makes for
                    a proper timeout spot when disciplining your puppy</li>
                <li>Always safeguard your backyard and garden with a fence to avoid a panic attack and having to search
                    the neighborhood for your puppy</li>

                How to Care for a Goldendoodle Puppy: Preparing for Puppy Habits and Behaviors
            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Raising a Goldendoodle puppy requires lots of patience and care, and great puppy parents are always
                rewarded with obedient and loving companions that mellow with age. We were all kids once, so in a funny
                way, we know exactly what to expect from human children — from unbridled curiosity and wild mood swings
                to unintentional (or intentional) destruction and completely unpredictable behavior, among other things.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                But, what about dogs?
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Sure, we can liken a puppy to a child, and in many ways, the similarities are strikingly adorable. But
                unlike people, dogs spend their whole lives on all fours and use their face, nose and mouth in the same
                way we use our hands. They're also barely a few weeks old before they're running, jumping and exploring
                their physical limitations.

                As a Goldendoodle puppy parent, you sure are in for plenty of fun! Your new pup will bring laughter and
                joy into your days as they steal your heart and win your love. But to start off on the right paw, you
                should always know exactly what you're in for before bringing that innocent-looking bundle of fluff into
                your home. Now we'll teach you how to care for a Goldendoodle Puppy with a few pointers on what to
                expect, some do's and don'ts — and how to be the best puppy parent you can be.

                Controlling Common Puppy Behavior
            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                The last thing any dog owner wants is their pet developing adult dog behavior problems, but unless you
                make an effort to discourage troublesome puppy behavior at a young age, they might retain bad habits as
                they grow. Here are some common puppy habits that you'll need to check early — and the best ways to get
                results.

                Chewing</h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Chewing is a big part of growing up for puppies, as it brings relief to teething pain and is essential
                for the development of strong teeth and jaws. However, what your puppy chews on will be entirely up to
                you. When learning how to care for a Goldendoodle puppy — you'll also be learning how to care for your
                things! Your job as a Goldendoodle puppy parent will be to discourage them from chewing on your shoes,
                furniture and other belongings and encourage them to chew on their toys, bones and rawhides. Early on, a
                big part of the job is to simply keep chewable possessions out of your pup's reach, but their long-term
                habits will require a little bit of training on your part in the form of bones, rawhides and puppy toys.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                To prevent choking, make sure to always keep an eye on your pup when you start offering chewable treats.
                When you do give your puppy something, to chew, make sure to praise and pet them when they chew it — as
                this teaches them that chewing on their toys makes you happy. If you catch your puppy chewing on
                something you'd wish they didn't, stop them immediately and replace the object with one of their bones
                or toys while giving them praise. This way, they'll learn to associate chewing on certain objects with
                your positive reaction. That's pretty much it!

                Nipping and Mouthing
            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Don't be shocked when your puppy gives you your first nip on the finger — it's non-aggressive and
                perfectly normal puppy behavior! </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Puppies nip because they're teething and haven't learned that biting your hands is unpleasant for you.
                This may be one of the more difficult puppy habits to break because they might get stimulated to nip
                when you're giving them a pet, and who can resist petting that adorable furry head — even at the cost of
                a nip!
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Another possible solution to puppy nipping is gently holding your pup's lower jaw in between your thumb
                and forefinger when they start to nip (one finger inside of the mouth and one finger on the outside).
                Don't let go for long enough to annoy them and until your puppy decides it's tired of that game and
                pulls away. When they do, try giving them your hand again, and if they start biting again just do the
                same thing. Repeat the process until your puppy simply licks your hand or ignores it, and when they do,
                reward them with some praise.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                If you have children around, make sure to persistently discourage nipping. When your child wants to pet
                the puppy, try to distract the puppy with a chew toy while they're being petted and continue the same
                training methods as mentioned above. By learning how to care for a Goldendoodle puppy's nipping habits
                early on, you may also be preventing more harmful biting habits as they age.

                Jumping
            </h3>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Jumping on you is your puppy's way of getting attention and expressing their emotions — all of which are
                signs of a happy and healthy dog. But it's not a habit that you want your dog to carry on into
                adulthood, as it can get a little rough and become more annoying the bigger they get. As much as you may
                love getting jumped on by your little pup when you get home from work, it's best to discourage this
                behavior early on and give them a chance to express their affection in other ways — like licking your
                face!
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                Remember, when your puppy jumps on you, they are demanding your attention. Maybe you've been gone all
                day, and it's their way of welcoming you home. Either way, your reaction is what they're after, whether
                you hug them back or push them off (even negative reactions reward their need for attention, which is
                important to remember when training them to stop).
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">
                When your puppy jumps on you, avoid making a physical reaction. Instead, fold your arms and say “down”,
                “off”, or “sit”. Your puppy vocabulary will play an important role here, particularly if you're already
                working on training them with words like “sit”. If your puppy is still jumping you on, try turning your
                back to them and ignoring them until they follow your command and stop jumping. When your dog sits down,
                reinforce their good behavior with praise.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-tight text-[12px]">

            </p>
            <p class=" text-base font-normal text-gray-500 ">

                Any time your puppy starts jumping again, repeat the process by ignoring them and repeating the
                commands. This way, your Goldendoodle puppy will begin to understand that demanding your attention by
                jumping on you will actually have the opposite effect of getting ignored. By saving their energy for a
                wagging tail, they'll get all the love and attention they could possibly want!

                Most dogs are lactose intolerant and are unable to properly digest dairy products such as milk and
                cheese. Ingestion can lead to symptoms such as upset tummy, vomiting and diarrhea. While it's not really
                a dangerous food for dogs, milk can cause symptoms of both intolerance and allergies. Believe it or not,
                milk has the same effect on cats!

            How to Care for a Goldendoodle Puppy: Puppy Don'ts
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">It should go without saying that you should never slap or
            hit your puppy as a punishment. Remember, puppies absolutely love getting attention and making you happy,
            and successful discipline is a simple matter of reinforcing good behavior with praise, treats and lots of
            pets.

        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Getting physical with your puppy will only confuse them and can cause harmful side-effects such as
            “hand-shy” trauma — or the fear of hands. Your puppy may also develop an element of fear in your presence
            and may even begin to avoid you. At worst, your dog can become defensive and even feel the need to protect
            itself. Of course, a puppy may also consider your slaps and taps as a playful gesture, and respond with
            equal roughhousing and set you back even further. For these reasons and good animal care, disciplining your
            dog should never involve physical punishment.

            You're Already So Much Better at Puppy Parenting!
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-body-color dark:text-dark-6">
            Just like that, you've already learned so much about raising a pup! Remember, training isn't a one-day
            affair. Raising a Goldendoodle puppy will require your patience and commitment from one day to the next,
            so make an effort to train your puppy for a few minutes every day to keep things routine and help them
            form good habits. Dedication is what makes a good puppy parent — and a great dog!

            We hope you're as excited to meet your new puppy as they are to meet you. Sure, puppies and dogs may
            seem like a handful at times, but the amount of joy, companionship and entertainment they offer will
            make any effort in raising them pale in comparison. As you get used to your new puppy, you'll fall into
            a rhythm of patience and care that becomes second nature and see your pup grow into a beautiful and
            loyal dog. After all, a good dog is family first, and a pet second.
