            Puppy Zs and its
            licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
            against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses
            (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a. your use and access

            partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
            consequential or punitive damages, including, without limitation, a loss of profits, data, use,

            whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth
            herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2 class="my-4 text-xl font-extrabold  leading-none md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl uppercase mt-8">Disclaimer</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 font-light text-gray-500 text-lg">Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The

            the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations
            above may not apply to you.</p>

            these Terms will not
            be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
            unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms
            constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior
