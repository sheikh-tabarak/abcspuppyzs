                                Our Reservation process for each of Our Litters works on a First Come, First Served
                                Basis. This simply means that the FIRST Family to Lock In their Chosen Puppy Momma and a
                                Male or a Female will have what is known as the "Pick of the Litter". This of course
                                would be based on whether they reserved a Male or a Female Puppy and if they are
                                available in that litter. So the FOURTH-Choice Female simply means the FOURTH available
                                Female after FIRST, SECOND, and THIRD-Choice have already been reserved.
                                <br><br>
                                We are all about the "Right Fit" and Temperament Pairing when it comes to Our Pups and
                                their Forever Families. If you've been busy researching the amazing Goldendoodle Breed,
                                then you've surely come across countless sites loaded with Puppies of all shapes and
                                sizes (and breeds for that matter). And while we are a business, we prefer to take a
                                much more personal approach and are grateful for the shared memories with Future Owners
                                and their Fluffy Family additions!
                                <br><br>
                                This is why you will NEVER see us accepting deposits and especially payments online
                                through Our Website as though we were some sort of e-commerce platform. THIS IS NOT US!
                                We prefer to cater to Families who are "ALL IN" when it comes to their Goldendoodle. We
                                LOVE Visitors and encourage you to make the trip to Our Family Estate, where you can
                                meet some of Our Puppy Parents and spend time with the Pups during a No-Obligation Puppy
                                Selection. This is a time when you can feel at home with the pups and as comfortable as
                                can be while you make your Selection. Stop by and relax, play, or just cuddle with One

                                Upon Request. These Early Reservations require an additional One-Time Non-Refundable
                                payment of $25, which simply means that you can Transfer your Reservation any way you
                                see fit and not have to worry about paying the Fee again (e.g., Work Trip and you need
                                to push back to another Litter, or Work Trip cancelled and you want to move up to an
                                earlier Litter, etc.).

                                For Early Reservations, the Process is two-fold, where we first hold a Goldendoodle
                                Puppy Conference (Face-to-Face Teams Video Call or Face-to-Face Meeting at Our Family
                                Home as We LOVE Visitors!) along with Our Reservation Agreement signed and verified
                                electronically via DocuSign. Our Puppy Reservation Agreement requires the Reservation
                                Deposit to be made after you finish signing.

                                To ensure that all of our Goldendoodle puppies go to a loving home, we perform a puppy
                                parent candidate screening, which allows us to collect information on the future family
                                of our pup and makes it easy to provide you with payment information and further
                                details.
                                <br><br>
                                If you would like to reserve a Goldendoodle Puppy, you may choose from any of Our
                                Available Goldendoodle Puppies or reserve a pup from a future litter. Once you've
                                completed a Goldendoodle Puppy Conference and Our Puppy Reservation Agreement, you are
                                totally locked in!

                                These are Our Babies, and we would not want you jumping into Puppydum unless there is
                                110% commitment on Your Part! This especially means that we do not want you to be so
                                concerned over any money you put down that you jump into a rash decision just because
                                you did not want to forfeit those funds! Puppies are priceless, and we also consider
                                that plans can and quite often do change on a dime. We just ask that you let us know as
                                soon as possible if you wish to CANCEL or TRANSFER Your Reservation.

                            <p>
                                At ABCs Puppy Zs, we know you can't wait to get your hands on one of our soft and loving
                                Goldendoodle puppies! But as Responsible Dog Breeders, it's our job to ensure that every
                                puppy is as ready as can be!
                                <br><br>
                                That's why we follow strict puppy development guidelines that promote healthy
                                socialization and make it easier for you to raise the perfect family dog. Just like
                                human babies, puppies are unable to learn certain things until their brains are simply
                                big enough! And thanks to extensive scientific research, we know exactly when it's time
                                for behavioral and social development to begin — which leads to excellent temperament,
                                sociability, and confidence as puppies grow.
                                <br><br>
                                We're not here to bash other breeders, but by now, the critical socialization period for
                                puppies should be common knowledge among dog breeders everywhere. And while
                                socialization typically begins around 3 to 6 weeks and lasts up to the time Your Pup
                                turns 20 weeks, most breeders should also know that some of the most important stages
                                can't even begin until the puppy is 7 to 8 weeks old!
                                <br><br>
                                From behavioral refinement (beginning around 7 weeks) to fear imprint (beginning around
                                8 weeks), some of the most sensitive training periods occur right before Go-Home! And
                                because most lessons don't happen overnight, it's just as important to follow through on
                                these life experiences daily — which puppies are learning permanently!
                                <br><br>
                                When we place the softest puppy you've ever felt into your arms, we want you to know
                                that everything has already been done for good social and behavioral health to take
                                root. Of course, you still have a puppy to raise — that's why we're here to provide all
                                the help, tips, and tricks you'll ever need!
                                <br><br>
                                Our commitment to puppy breeding done right has resulted in some of the happiest dogs
                                (and owners!) out there. And when it comes to Goldendoodles, ABCs Puppy Zs is here to
                                offer the Most Dependable Family-Raised Puppies you can find.
                                <br><br>
                                Trust us, it's worth the wait!
                                <br><br>
                                *Go-Home for Toys, Teacups, and Micro Teacups typically begins around 12 weeks and can
                                go up to 16 weeks.

                                As a Responsible Small Family Goldendoodle Breeder, we take Great Pride in the Level and
                                Degree of Our Internally Developed Health Testing Protocols. Our Sole Purpose is not
                                only to maintain the Line of First Generation Goldendoodles, but We Have Endeavored to
                                Set the Bold Goal of Improving that Line.
                                <br><br>
                                We Honestly could not call Ourselves a Responsible Breeder if we did not have a
                                Spay/Neuter Contract with All of Our Pups. This is something that we Believe in to the
                                Core and Appreciate the Excellence that Anyone May Apply to such A Practice of
                                Responsibility. With that in Mind, Yes, We Strongly Enforce Our Spay/Neuter Contract! If
                                we do not receive the appropriate documentation along with the Veterinarian of Record
                                information that allows us to call and verify the procedure was performed after the age
                                of 12 months and before the age of 18 months, then the 5-Year Health Guarantee becomes
                                null and void.

                                This is not to say we will balk at working with another Breeder, but as all of the Top
                                Tier AKC Breed Clubs of Merit do, We Require You to Prove Yourself first. For all the
                                interested Responsible Breeders out there, please do not hesitate to Contact Us, or
                                better yet, Schedule A Goldendoodle Puppy Conference so we may discuss this further.
                                Overall, we just want to make sure Our Pups are going to Loving Families (and Those
                                Responsible, Morally Bound Breeders) as such that they may Align Themselves and have
                                Wonderful Lives.

                                At ABCs Puppy Zs, Our 5-Year Goldendoodle Puppy Health Guarantee* is just us putting our
                                money where our mouth is in the way of promising great puppy health and giving new
                                owners certain options in the case of a life-threatening congenital health condition
                                onset during the first 5 years with their Goldendoodle. The Health Guarantee is standard
                                and uniform in all respects; however, it does not cover aliments such as hypoglycemia or
                                conditions that can be sourced to or aggravated by exogenous factors.
                                <br><br>
                                Dog health problems can be very difficult to talk about, because we all fall in love
                                with these pups the moment they're born and want them to be as healthy and happy as can
                                be. While we stand by our first-rate Goldendoodle Breeding Program, unfortunately, a
                                100% clean bill of health from birth is impossible for any living thing and we can only
                                dream of never having to worry about the onset of diseases and conditions that may be
                                present from birth.
                                <br><br>
                                To give you confidence in your Goldendoodle puppy purchase, we offer a 5-Year Health
                                Guarantee, which, in the case of any life-threatening congenital disease onset, allows
                                to you receive a full refund in the 1st year and a replacement Goldendoodle puppy in the
                                subsequent years of ownership. Let's all hope that's the last you have to hear about our
                                health guarantee, and you can rest assured that we have done and will continue to do
                                everything imaginably possible to promote enduring health and a long and happy life for
                                all of Our Dogs!

                                <br><br>
                                A Puppy Mill is basically the exact OPPOSITE of a Family-Raised Puppy Home — which we're
                                so proud to be!
                                <br><br>
                                If there was a button to shut down every Puppy Mill in the world right now, we'd smash
                                it with our fist! That's because a Puppy Mill is exactly what it sounds like — it's
                                practically a factory for breeding puppies!
                                <br><br>
                                As dog owners and professional Goldendoodle breeders who love animals, the idea of
                                maximum output at minimal cost on something as precious as babies makes us SICK!! That's
                                why we're all about keeping puppy-parents-to-be informed about the risks of buying from
                                puppy mills — and how to AVOID THEM!
                                <br><br>
                                But as with all things bad, Puppy Mills will try hard to fool you by acting innocent. In
                                our book, Puppy Mill owners are little better than con artists. They'll pull every
                                excuse in the book to get your money. After all, it only costs them one of their
                                countless puppies! Ugh!
                                <br><br>
                                Fortunately for interested puppy parents, there are enough dead giveaways to get the
                                answer without them having to spell it out — and we're here to pull the curtain!
                                Telltale signs include advertising suspiciously cheap puppies, making it very easy to
                                buy a dog, little to no waiting time, and wanting to know nothing about you — or where
                                their puppy is going! If it seems like the puppy is too easy to get, it might be because
                                there are hundreds of them!
                                <br><br>
                                Buying a Puppy from a Puppy Mill not only supports this terrible industry, but it's bad
                                for both the dog AND the owner. There's a reason we promote our family-raised puppy
                                process to the stars, because it results in the ABSOLUTE BEST PUPPIES — and happy
                                humans!
                                <br><br>
                                Puppy Mills disregard all the essentials when it comes to raising healthy dogs — because
                                they DON'T RAISE THEM! Every check box gets a huge X on how to breed a puppy right —
                                from parent breed selection and DNA screening to healthy nursing conditions,
                                socialization, training and development support. As a result, these dogs may go on to
                                have all kinds of health problems throughout life, not to mention miss out on
                                once-in-a-lifetime developmental opportunities. Just knowing these Puppy Mills are out
                                there makes us hold onto our precious Goldendoodle puppies all the more dearly!

                                you could even consider?

                                That's a great question, because part of having healthy Goldendoodle puppies is ensuring
                                that both parents—and especially Our Puppy Moms—are in very good health and ready to
                                make healthy and happy offspring. At ABCs Puppy Zs, we perform comprehensive health
                                checkups on all of Our Puppy Parents at least twice a year. We also obtain their Breed
                                Class of Certifications from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) along with a
                                Comprehensive Breed Specific DNA Panel for a complete genetics background on all of Our
                                Puppy Parents.

                                In this way, we do our best to prevent certain health conditions that are known to occur
                                in both the Poodle and the Golden Retriever breed from being passed on to the
                                Goldendoodle puppies. All of the details on Our Puppy Parent Health testing performed

                                Goldendoodles are part Poodle and part Golden Retriever, which means they inherit DNA

                                their offspring by running comprehensive DNA background checks on the puppy parents.

                                A Goldendoodle is the wonderful result of a controlled cross-breed between a purebred
                                male Poodle and a female purebred Golden Retriever. The idea was first conceived back in
                                1969, when breeders sought a guide dog that could match the Golden Retriever in
                                obedience, health and trainability while suiting people allergic to dog hair.

                            <p>
                                The Poodle turned out to be the perfect match, and passes traits of intelligence,
                                athleticism, a loving personality and great looks along with its non-shedding coat on to
                                its Goldendoodle offspring. A match made in heaven!

                                teacup sizes!

                                Poodles were bred across generations for the purpose of making a smaller variety, so
                                today there are 3 poodle sizes with an additional mini size unique to Goldendoodles.

                                Regardless of which size dog you're looking for, Our Goldendoodle Puppies retain all of
                                the amazing qualities both parent breeds have to offer.

                                Just wait till you get one! But before you do, we're all too happy to let you in on why
                                Goldendoodles are among the top choice for therapy dogs in the world.
                                <br><br>
                                If you'd believe it, Goldendoodles were actually bred to be therapy dogs for allergy
                                sufferers! When breeders realized that many people needed a therapy dog but couldn't
                                have one because of allergies, they got to work on a crossbreed that could come to the
                                rescue for allergy sufferers everywhere!
                                <br><br>
                                So what were they looking for in a therapy dog?
                                <br><br>
                                Well, since they needed a dog that's hypoallergenic, their first choice was easily one
                                of the most hypoallergenic dogs in the world — the Poodle!
                                <br><br>
                                Fortunately for all of us, the Poodle already came with some of the best therapy dog
                                qualities they were looking for!
                                <br><br>
                                Poodles are darn smart, and smarts are a must for any dog with big responsibilities. But
                                smarts alone won't cut it for a therapy dog, because they also have to be loyal,
                                trainable and very patient — and the Poodle absolutely is! Therapy dogs are companions
                                at heart, and a companion is someone who loves your company. And few dogs love human
                                company quite like a Poodle, just ask a Poodle owner!
                                <br><br>
                                They are very social animals who make natural family members — and it's just one of the
                                many wonderful traits they pass right down to the Goldendoodle!
                                <br><br>
                                But let's not forget the other side of the family — the Golden Retriever!
                                <br><br>
                                These athletic, fun-loving dogs are some of the most popular family pets in America. Go
                                to any park (or dog park!) and you're sure to see a big fluffy Golden Retriever running
                                around. Their strong and healthy builds, keen attentiveness and wonderful temperament
                                are all beloved qualities of a family pet — and therapy dog!
                                <br><br>
                                So when you put these two amazing breeds together, you basically have the therapy dog of
                                your dreams! If you ask us, a therapy dog is just another way of saying best best
                                friend. You don't need to have a therapy dog to feel like a Goldendoodle is exactly what
                                you needed — they make life better no matter who you are! But if you actually do need a
                                therapy dog, how could we not recommend a dog that was uniquely bred to be everything
                                you could ask for and more?
                                <br><br>
                                With the success of the Goldendoodle crossbreed, the world fell in love with a healthy,
                                beautiful new dog and found a solution to an age-old sneezing problem. Now, even people
                                with severe allergies can have a therapy dog to help them with their lives — and be the
                                sweetest, fluffiest companion in the world!

                                The different letters and numbers simply refer to the Goldendoodle's Generation and
                                which percentage of Golden Retriever and Poodle are in that generation.

                            <p>
                                For example, an F1, also called F1A, is a First-Generation Goldendoodle with 50% Poodle
                                and 50% Golden Retriever.

                            <p>
                                Breeding an F1 Goldendoodle with a purebred Poodle results in an F1B Goldendoodle, which
                                is more Poodle than Golden Retriever at a ratio of 75% Poodle to 25% Golden Retriever.

                                An F1BB (typically referred to as an F1B) Goldendoodle is the result of cross-breeding
                                between a first-generation F1B and a purebred Poodle. This breed is still more Poodle
                                than Golden Retriever, but only slightly more Poodle than in a first-generation F1B.

                                This question is making new rounds in the veterinary and scientific communities, and for
                                good reason. It turns out that spaying and neutering has been linked to an increase in
                                the possibility of certain illnesses and conditions in dogs.
                                <br><br>
                                At ABCs Puppy Zs, we've always followed and promoted the accepted veterinary guidelines
                                on neutering and spaying. But we humbly believe it's time for all of us—veterinarians,
                                breeders, and dog owners included—to take a sober look at the modern health implications
                                of these procedures.
                                <br><br>
                                While we still fully support neutering or spaying your dog, the age at which it can be
                                done without potentially complicating your dog's health has recently come into question.
                                As it turns out, it's not as simple as we all previously thought.
                                <br><br>
                                It's important to note that, in most cases, spaying and neutering does not negatively
                                affect a dog's health. In fact, the health implications we're about to outline may be
                                referring to a 1-2% increase in onset likelihood for certain conditions. But at the same
                                time, other conditions have shown a much higher rate of occurrence in spayed/neutered
                                dogs. Importantly, the science is still a work and progress, but is already revealing a
                                clear connection between spaying/neutering and increased risk of illness. Especially
                                when it comes to our dogs, we'd never consider even a small increase in vulnerability to
                                illness or disorder as something marginal.
                                <br><br>
                                To fully summarize the science behind these findings in a few paragraphs would make for
                                some very technical wording. Instead, we'll offer a layman's explanation and encourage
                                you to follow up with a call to us or by doing your own thorough research.
                                <br><br>
                                When animals—in this case, dogs—are spayed or neutered, the hormones associated with
                                reproduction are affected. No duh, it's the whole reason we do it! But the thing is,
                                some of those reproduction hormones may actually have other functions, too. For example,
                                luteinizing hormone (LH) in dogs triggers ovulation and production of testosterone, but
                                research suggests it may also play a role in the immune system.
                                <br><br>
                                In the case of LH, this hormone seems to have a positive effect on lymphocytes, one of
                                the key white blood cell types in the immune system. So how does the immune system
                                behave without it? Well, researchers found that lymphoma and other types of cancers
                                occurred at much higher rates in neutered dogs.
                                <br><br>
                                But it's not just increased risk to certain types of cancers. Researchers have also
                                found that neutering/spaying may be linked to urinary incontinence, obesity,
                                hypothyroidism and hip dysplasia in dogs.
                                <br><br>
                                Another interesting fact is that gonadal hormones have a major role in bone growth —
                                they actually help stop bone length when it reaches normal size. Research has shown that
                                dogs spayed or neutered before completing puberty may be taller and have longer long
                                bones — which puts them at a higher risk for injuries!
                                <br><br>
                                In short, to answer the question, spaying or neutering should not be done before 18-24
                                months of age, at the end of puberty. But the bigger question is, should it be done at
                                all?
                                <br><br>
                                We are leaning towards the position that there may be healthier alternatives to pet
                                population control. Some are vasectomy in males, hormonal regulation implants, and
                                intratesticular injection in puppies.
                                <br><br>
                                We believe that this conversation will only get bigger over time. For now, it's our duty
                                as dog breeders to share the information above with as many people as possible and
                                explore the options available to us — and our dogs.
